# Does Economic Concept Selection Matter for Monetary Policy Shock Identification?

**Evidence and Mathematical Analysis from Aruoba & Drechsel (2024, *AEJ*)**

---

## Overview

This project replicates and extends Aruoba & Drechsel (2024), who identify monetary policy shocks by scoring sentiment for 296 hand-picked economic concepts using the Loughran-McDonald dictionary within ±10-word windows.

We ask: **how robust is this method to the specific choice of concepts?**

### Key Findings

1. **Concept selection is subjective.** Human vs. LLM curation: only 62.6% overlap.
2. **Labels barely matter for the original list.** Shuffling all 296 concept labels drops R² by only 0.03 out of 0.96.
3. **This is because 86% of the original concepts are pro-cyclical** — they point the same direction within any meeting.
4. **List composition determines regularization.** A balanced (50/50) concept list causes Ridge cross-validation to select near-zero penalty, leading to overfitting. The method's robustness is *conditional* on the list being dominated by a single common factor.
5. **Mathematical proofs** show that under a strong common factor, shuffled-label shocks are nearly identical to original shocks, and the CV-optimal penalty is a function of the singular value spectrum.
